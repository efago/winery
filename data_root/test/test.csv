1981,US,"The vintage was a good one for all K-J's Cabernets, and this Grand Reserve offers lots of bang for your buck.

4062,South Africa,"The name certainly gives a clear indication of what to expect from this wine, with prominent herbal aromas and flavors of fresh mint, fynbos and licorice root that frame the blackberry and raspberry fruit core. The fine-grain tannins are fleeting, but provide enough structure to the spiced fruit flavors. Notes of Thin Mint, menthol and pepper linger long on the finish. Drink now–2016.",The Mint,89,45.0,Stellenbosch,,,Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz,Thelema 2009 The Mint Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch),Cabernet Sauvignon,Thelema
8143,France,"This is a bit more confected and immediately approachable than some of the cave cooperative's other cuvées, but it remains a well made, very drinkable rosé. Scents of bubble gum and crushed multivitamin kick things off, followed by flavors of mixed berries and citrus, finishing on a zesty lime note.

473,Italy,This blend of Sangiovese and Montepulciano is definitely on the ripe and jammy side with aromas of mature blackberry and fruit marmalade.

2586,France,"The terroir range of wines from Philippe Zinck is made to showcase the vineyards, in this case a chalk and clay property near Eguisheim.

9410,Argentina,"Deep purple in color, with an inky nose that brings licorice and jammy black fruit aromas. This is a lush, soft-bodied style of Syrah with a meaty mouthfeel and candied, jammy flavors of blackberry and stewed black cherry.

6179,South Africa,"The 2007 vintage was generally a great one for Bordeaux-style reds in Stellenbosch, and the Els Signature definitely demonstrates it. Sure, it's ripe and sexy with a lot of sweet oak characteristics like cocoa powder and smoky wood, but it's got the ripe fruit core of black plum and dark forest berries to back it up. Spicy layers of leather, cigar box and black tea leaves add complexity to the palate, while chewy tannins provide a firm structure. A bit young now, so try after 2015.",Signature,93,95.0,Stellenbosch,,,Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz,Ernie Els 2007 Signature Red (Stellenbosch),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ernie Els

3925,France,"Just off dry, this is a rounded soft wine that takes its name after the sun god Apollo from the sunny exposure of the vineyard.
