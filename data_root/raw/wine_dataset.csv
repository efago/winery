9984,US,"Pale copper in color, this was initially pressed for a sparkling wine program before making a rosé. Its flavors are thin and underripe, with little red fruit, delivering instead skin characteristics and tannins.",Delfina Vineyard Pinot Noir,85,28.0,Oregon,McMinnville,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Coelho 2016 Delfina Vineyard Pinot Noir Rosé (McMinnville),Rosé,Coelho
9985,France,"Some richness and smoky flavors, although the acidity is also very present.

9986,Chile,"With floral aromas mixed with darker notes of asphalt, mineral, leather and berry fruit, this opens well. The palate is rubbery in feel but structured. Flavors of bold berry fruits, chocolate and herbs end chewy, warm and chocolaty. For a basic Carmenère-Cabernet blend, this is on the money.",Chamán Reserva,89,15.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Viña Santa Cruz 2011 Chamán Reserva Carmenère-Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),Carmenère-Cabernet Sauvignon,Viña Santa Cruz

9988,Austria,"While the nose is slow to express itself, the palate immediately bursts with crisp, tart apple, with fresh, green pear, with ripe but zesty citrus. There is an innate lightness and lovely depth in this unforced, honest and utterly refreshing wine. It comes on light feet and draws you in with its fresh-faced authenticity.

9989,Italy,"Made from a blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 15% Alicante, 10% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of black currant, bell pepper and clove. The palate offers mature black cherry, ginger and a hint of vanilla while firm tannins grip the finish.",Dròmos,89,49.0,Tuscany,Maremma Toscana,,Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe,Poggio Verrano 2009 Dròmos  (Maremma Toscana),Red Blend,Poggio Verrano
9990,US,"Deep and delicious with inviting layers of raspberry and berry cobbler, Big John is a brambly, structured Zin, with bright zaps of black pepper and clove, plus a long, satisfying finish. This is perhaps the best Zin in all of Calaveras County right now.",Big John,92,36.0,California,Calaveras County,Sierra Foothills,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Newsome-Harlow 2010 Big John Zinfandel (Calaveras County),Zinfandel,Newsome-Harlow
9991,Spain,"Fresh, perky, sweaty and citric on the nose, which all creates a textbook bouquet. The palate is slightly spritzy, with flavors of passionfruit, pineapple and sweet white grapefruit. Fresh yet a little fleshy, with a long, zesty finish. Drink as soon as possible to capture the essence of a fine vintage.",,90,23.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,José Pariente 2009 Verdejo (Rueda),Verdejo,José Pariente
9992,Israel,"Light straw in the glass, this wine has aromas of pineapple and lemon zest. Refreshing on the palate, it offers flavors of clementine, lemon, orange rind, and honeysuckle.

9993,Argentina,This gold-colored stale-smelling Torrontés smells like old apple juice. A chunky flat palate offers bland oxidized bitter flavors.

9994,Germany,"Ebullient floral and honey notes bolster the intense, ripe, fleshy mango and peach flavors in this powerful Riesling. Full bodied and remarkably dry in style, with a richly textured, almost feathered mouthfeel. It finishes exceptionally long, with a bristle of lemon-lime acidity.",Rüdesheim Berg Rottland Erstes Gewächs,93,68.0,Rheingau,,,Anna Lee C.

9995,France,"The fruit bursts out of the glass, while the supporting tannins give power and intensity to this concentrated wine. It has all the richness of 2005, backed with juicy red fruits and some vibrant acidity. Age this wine, although its generous character means you could drink it in 5 years.

9996,US,"There's a noticeable tilt of barrel reduction in this wine that keeps it more closed-off than desired. Otherwise, the experience is full bodied in baked bread and black cherry, with a tangy freshness to the finish.",Magnolia,87,30.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Krutz 2014 Magnolia Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Pinot Noir,Krutz
9997,France,"This perfumed, herbal blend of Syrah and Grenache is tight and very crisp. It has intense tangy acidity and a lively fruity aftertaste.

9998,Spain,"Berry candy and licorice aromas become more subtle and earthy with air. It feels grabby and abrasive as many Toro's are prone to be, with blackberry and root notes and a sugar beet flavor.

9999,Australia,"This blend of 70% Grenache, 25% Shiraz and 5% Mourvèdre features surprisingly dark fruit flavors akin to blackberries and cola. A hint of mint or eucalyptus enlivens the bouquet and helps to lighten this otherwise rather full-bodied, brooding wine. Finishes long, with enough dusty tannins to warrant cellaring through 2015.",The Ironstone Pressings,90,65.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,D'Arenberg 2005 The Ironstone Pressings G-S-M (McLaren Vale),G-S-M,D'Arenberg
