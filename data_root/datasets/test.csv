1331,Austria,"Stone, earth and pear show on the nose. The palate joins with a bittersweet notion that recalls dried pear skin and dried orange rind. The body remains light, but flavors are anchored deeply and earthily. Made in a very balanced late-harvest style, it has an off-dry finish that will be dreamy with salty cheese.",Cuvée Spätlese,92,15.0,Burgenland,,,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Gunter Triebaumer 2016 Cuvée Spätlese Chardonnay (Burgenland),Chardonnay,Gunter Triebaumer

9229,US,"Oak dominates this Chardonnay, with buttered toast and butterscotch notes offering an immediate impact. Underneath the oak tones are very rich, opulent flavors of pineapple and orange jam and lime tart. It's a bit jumbled now, but this may be a Chardonnay that can take some cellaring.

7471,US,"This blend of Syrah, Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Grenache is enormously fruity. It erupts in the mouth with black raspberries and cherries, with a hint of smoky oak and raisins.
